# Changelog

All notable changes to HyprMod will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Command-line profile switching (#50): `hyprmod profile apply <name>` switches profiles without opening the window (bindable to a keybind or scriptable), `hyprmod profile next` / `previous` cycle through them alphabetically (wrapping around, great for a single keybind), and `hyprmod profile list` shows the saved profiles with the active one marked. The profile list, in the app and on the command line, is now ordered alphabetically
- Multiple keyboard layouts (#44): the Keyboard layouts row opens a dialog to add, reorder, edit, and remove input sources (a layout plus its variant), written to `kb_layout` and `kb_variant`

### Changed

- The Gestures page is hidden when there's no touchpad or touchscreen, since its workspace-swipe options need one to do anything. With only one device present, the page stays and the unusable subsection greys out

### Fixed

- Changing the active or inactive window border color in Lua mode no longer fails with an `invalid color` error; a single-color border was sent to Hyprland with a redundant `0deg` angle that its Lua config manager rejected (#43)
- Migrating a `hyprland.conf` to Lua no longer drops or breaks keybinds: concatenated and mixed-case modifiers (`SUPERSHIFT`, `Alt`) now decompose into canonical tokens, and nested `match { … }` blocks in block-form `windowrule`/`layerrule` nest correctly instead of being rejected (#45)
- Disabling a monitor no longer makes it vanish from the Monitors page; hyprmod now reads disabled outputs too, so a turned-off monitor stays listed and can be switched back on (https://github.com/BlueManCZ/hyprland-socket/pull/2)
- Re-enabling a disabled monitor no longer overlaps or snaps onto another monitor, comes back at its preferred mode when Hyprland reports `0x0` after a reboot, and no longer crashes the Monitors page with `scales must not be empty` (#46)
- Workspace rules in generated Lua configs now write the workspace selector as a string (`workspace = "1"` instead of `workspace = 1`); `hl.workspace_rule` declares the field as a string, and the integer form relied on Lua's implicit coercion and was flagged by lua-language-server (#48)
- "Refresh monitors" no longer discards unsaved monitor changes and clears the pending-changes indicator
- The workspace rule dialog's appearance overrides are now single "Use global / On / Off" dropdowns; the previous override-switch-plus-value-switch pair could keep showing "On" after the value was switched off
- Binds using the `global` dispatcher (app-registered global shortcuts, e.g. `bind = SUPER, period, global, caelestia:emoji`) no longer fail to apply in Lua mode; the dispatcher had no Lua mapping (#49)
- The first-run setup dialog no longer reappears when HyprMod's include line lives in a sourced sub-file rather than directly in `hyprland.lua` / `hyprland.conf`; detection now follows the whole `source` / `require` / `dofile` chain instead of inspecting only the top-level entrypoint (#51)
- Migrating to Lua no longer breaks keybinds that use a modifier variable (`$shiftMod = $mainMod SHIFT`); the variable now joins its modifiers with `+` instead of leaking a space-separated `SUPER SHIFT` blob that Hyprland reads as a single unknown keysym (#52)
- Migrating to Lua no longer breaks workspace `layoutopt` rules; `layoutopt:direction:right` now becomes a nested `layout_opts` table instead of a flat string that `hl.workspace_rule` rejects (#53)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Lua config support — read and edit `hyprland.lua` directly, with live preview against Hyprland 0.55+'s Lua runtime
- "Migrate to Lua…" wizard and main-window banner (Hyprland 0.55+) — converts your active `hyprland.conf` to `hyprland.lua`, rewrites the entrypoint include, and is dismissible
- Per-monitor "Identify by description" toggle — emits `monitor=desc:…` instead of `monitor=DP-1, …` so the saved configuration follows the physical monitor across port changes (#26)
- Per-monitor HDR controls — expanded Color Management presets (Auto/sRGB/Adobe/Wide/EDID/HDR/HDR EDID), SDR Brightness/Saturation sliders, advanced SDR/HDR luminance sliders, lock-step luminance controls, and safe defaults for first-time HDR setup (#29)
- Workspaces page — manage `workspace` rules with live preview and live IPC apply (#31)
- Deprecation assistant — detect and migrate deprecated Hyprland syntax with explicit user confirmation and timestamped backups
- Convenience installer (`install.sh`) and `hyprmod --install` / `--uninstall` flags — `pipx`/`uv tool` installs now register a desktop launcher entry and icon under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, with first-launch self-registration as a fallback
- Optional Name and Enabled fields in the window and layer rule dialogs for Hyprland's block-form / Lua named rules
- "Report a bug" link in Help menu and error toasts — opens prefilled GitHub issues with HyprMod version, Hyprland version, config language, and install method

### Changed

- Bind dialog's Manual Edit modifier picker is a compact two-row chip strip instead of stacked switch rows
- Options unavailable on the running Hyprland version are hidden instead of greyed-out; group headers collapse when every row in the group is unavailable
- Profiles transcode on activation — saving in Hyprlang then activating in Lua (or vice-versa) just works
- HyprMod no longer auto-migrates deprecated syntax silently on save; migrations are surfaced via the new deprecation assistant and require explicit user confirmation

### Fixed

- Keybinds using the Hyper modifier (and `CAPS`/`MOD2`/`MOD3`/`MOD5`) are now displayed and recorded correctly — previously `Caps Lock + G` under `caps:hyper` rendered as `+ G` and Record captured only `G` (#27)
- Toggling "Numlock by default" wrote an invalid `input:kb_numlock` option that Hyprland rejected on reload; the option is now written as `input:numlock_by_default` per the schema (#34)
- Rules from your managed config no longer leak into the read-only "external rules" list when `hyprland-gui.conf` is reached through a symlinked path (typical dotfiles setup)
- Named window and layer rules (block-form `windowrule { name = … }` or Lua `name = "…"`) are now recognized and editable instead of being silently dropped (#37)
- Autostart page surfaces `exec` / `exec-once` entries defined in your `hyprland.conf` (or any file it sources) as read-only rows alongside the managed ones, matching the existing behavior of the Env Variables, Window Rules, and Layer Rules pages (#37)
- Lua migration preserves Hyprlang `$var` references as named Lua locals instead of inlining their values or emitting literal `"$var"` strings that Hyprland rejected on reload (#38)
- Deleting or disabling a window rule with `float`, `tile`, `pin`, `fullscreen`, or `maximize` now reverts the effect on matching open windows instead of waiting for the next Hyprland reload
- Per-monitor VRR `Off` now writes `vrr, 0` and actually disables VRR; a new `Use global` option preserves the previous omit-the-clause behavior (#39)
- Window and layer rules now apply correctly on Hyprland < 0.53 and < 0.54, which expect the pre-v3 `windowrulev2` / `layerrule = effect, namespace` grammar; the v3 `match:` form hyprmod previously always emitted was rejected with `Invalid rulev2 found` (#41)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Window Rules page — manage `windowrule` entries with a window picker, curated action dropdown, and live preview
- Layer Rules page — manage `layerrule` entries with curated presets and live preview
- Autostart page — manage `exec` and `exec-once` entries with an app picker
- Env Variables page — manage `env` entries with POSIX name validation
- Pending Changes page — review every unsaved edit across the app in one place
- Mouse-drag (`bindm`) keybinds with dispatcher, category, and preset support (#20)
- Profile cards show the last-modified date alongside the option count

### Changed

- Sidebar reorganized by task
- Dwindle, Master, and Scrolling merged into a single Layouts page
- Profiles page redesigned — active profile promoted to a hero card with the saved-profiles list below
- Saving keeps the active profile in sync automatically; use the save split button's "without updating profile" option to intentionally diverge

### Fixed

- Gradient border colors written without `0x` prefix on save, causing Hyprland to reject the config on reload (#21)
- Keybind recorder captured the shifted keysym (e.g. `exclam` for `Shift+1`) instead of the unshifted one Hyprland expects when `SHIFT` is in the modifier mask (#22)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-21

Initial release.

### Added

- Native GTK4/libadwaita settings app for Hyprland with live preview via IPC
- Config isolation — HyprMod writes only to its own `hyprland-gui.conf`; the user's `hyprland.conf` is never modified
- Undo/redo with Ctrl+Z
- Profiles — save, name, and share complete configurations as `.conf` files
- Config DNA — a unique visual fingerprint per profile
- Bezier curve editor with draggable control points, live animation preview, and a preset library
- Monitor configuration with per-monitor resolution, refresh rate, position, scale, transform, and mirroring. VRR, HDR, and 10-bit detection
- Keybind editor with modifier toggles, interactive key capture, and dispatcher selection
- Cursor theme picker with live previews
- Master, Dwindle, and Scrolling layout options
- Global search across all options (Ctrl+F) with highlight-pulse navigation
- Configurable config path and an auto-save toggle
- About dialog with version info and debug details
- Keyboard shortcuts overlay
- In-app link to report issues on GitHub
- Version-aware schema resolution — loads the option catalog matching the running Hyprland version, falling back to the bundled schema on mismatch
- Automatic migration of deprecated Hyprland syntax on save
- Desktop integration: application icon, `.desktop` file, and AppStream metainfo
